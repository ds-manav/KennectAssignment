These are the three main benefits that i myself find best for why to use jwt.
1) IT is a stateless mechanism which means a user state is never saved in the database. 
   With jwt we dont need to query database to authenticate user for every api call.
2) It protects against Cross Site Request Forgery Attacks.
3) The size of JWT is very compact which means you can send it through HTTP header, Post parameter , or through a url.
